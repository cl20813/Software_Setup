Go to command or terminal in VSCode and ```pip install --upgrade pip``` to use -e editable option.   
'''cd /Users/joonwonlee/GEMS_TCO/GEMS_TCO'''

Note that '''pyproject.toml''' and '''setup.py''' are located at /Users/joonwonlee/GEMS_TCO/.

``` /opt/anaconda3/envs/gems_tco/bin/python -m pip install -e . --use-pep517 ```

# Window:

Open the anaconda command prompt because environment 'jl2815' is under there

cd c:\\Users\\joonw\\TCO
pip install .      

for this code to work, there has to be ```setup.py``` and ```pyproject.toml``` in TCO, and ```GEMS_TCO package folder``` must be at the same level, in TCO.
