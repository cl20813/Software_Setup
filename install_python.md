## Installation
Download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
(Note: there are a variety of different python distributions; for statistics and machine learning, we recommend Anaconda.)

### Creating an environment 

1. Open Terminal
2. Create an environment called `msds534` using `conda` with the command:
   ```conda create --name msds534```
3. To install packages in your environment, first activate your environment:
   ```conda activate msds534```
4. Then, install the following packages using the command:
   ```conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn``` 
5. Install PyTorch by running the appropriate command from [here](https://pytorch.org) (for macOS, the command is: `conda install pytorch::pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch`
6. To exit your environment:
   ```conda deactivate```

Here is a helpful [cheatsheet](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for `conda` environment commands.

### Share environment
1. Both pip packages and conda packages
```conda env export > my_env.yml```
mac:
``` conda env export > /Users/joonwonlee/Documents/GEMS_TCO-1/faiss_env.yml```     
This will make my_env.yml file in current working directory.   

3. Only include packages you've explicitly asekd for.
```conda env export --from-history >file.yml```

Also, this is not the best example of channel ordering in a YAML. Better practice would be priority of pytorch > conda-forge > defaults. When people want Pytorch, that should be highest priority, and if Conda Forge is at all needed, it should almost always take precedence over defaults. Otherwise, one risks encountering channel mixing issues.

### Create an environment from an .yml file
1. Create an environment from an .yml file (the file has to be in the current working directory) :                      
```conda env create -f name.yml```
mac:        
```conda env create --file /Users/joonwonlee/Documents/GEMS_TCO-1/faiss_env.yml```   
3. To verify that the new environment was installed correctly:               
```conda env list```              
4. Updating current working environment based on provided .yml file:             
```conda env update --prefix ./env --file environment.yml  --prune```             
4.Cloning an environment:               
```conda create --name new_environment --clone existing_env```       
verify with           
```conda ifo --envs```

### Installing packages in Jupyter notebook or Ipython environment.
Use !pip install numpy instead of pip install numpy if you want to directly install package in a notebook. The latter can't be used in notebook environment.   

If you want to add working environment in your local computer to jupyter notebook.
1. Open command prompt   
2. Activate the environment you want to add in jupyter notebook.
activate jl2815   
4. conda install -c anaconda ipykernel    (this should be done in an active environment)   
5. ipython kernel install --user --name=<envname>             (ipython kernel install --user --name=jl2815)
